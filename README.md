I had some experience with microservices prior to the course, but I was working mostly on development inside already existing services, so for me the most interesting part was the infrastructure-related one, things like services discovery, migration to K8S and different approaches to data and transaction management and this is the part I gained the most. I think this is enough to continue exploring cloud development further on my own.

The most difficult part in this project for me was to relate it to theoretical materials. For me they looked just like microservices - loosely coupled :) The topics are the same but at first we have a huge load of theory and then a bit of very abstract practical overview. I'd rather have practical session after each topic with live Q&As after each of them.
